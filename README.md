**üîé Background and Rationale for Churn Analysis**

In modern e-commerce, companies face rising customer acquisition costs (CAC) due to competitive digital advertising markets and saturated sales channels. At the same time, firms already possess a base of customers who have purchased before and therefore demonstrate established trust and familiarity with the brand.

Compared with acquiring new customers, retaining or winning back existing customers is significantly more cost-effective and yields higher profitability. For example, research shows that acquiring a new customer can cost 5‚Äì7 times more than retaining an existing one (Rudd, Huo, & Xu, 2023). A systematic review of churn studies between 2020 and 2024 further highlights that improving retention rates by just 5‚Äì10% can increase profits by 25‚Äì95% (Imani & Arabnia, 2025).

Thus, churn prevention and customer win-back strategies represent high-leverage opportunities for firms: by focusing resources on customers most likely to leave, companies can protect revenue and extend Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

**Why Churn Analysis Matters**

While recognizing the importance of retention, businesses must still address a practical challenge: budgets are limited. Marketing teams cannot afford to target every at-risk customer with retention offers.

This creates a data science optimization problem:

    Prediction ‚Äì Estimate churn probabilities and future value (CLV) for each customer.

    Cost modeling ‚Äì Estimate the cost of re-engaging each customer (discounts, outreach, incentives).

    Optimization ‚Äì Under a fixed budget (e.g., $100k), select the subset of customers that maximizes expected retained value.

Recent research supports this integrated ‚Äúpredict-and-optimize‚Äù approach. G√≥mez-Vargas, Maldonado, & Vairetti (2023) demonstrate that combining churn prediction with optimization leads to superior decision-making compared to ranking customers by churn probability alone.

Therefore, churn analysis is not just about predicting who leaves‚Äîit is about making evidence-based, resource-constrained decisions to maximize long-term profitability. This dual role makes churn projects highly relevant both technically and strategically.
