📖 Business Background and the Cost of Churn
1. Business Background

In today’s highly competitive e-commerce environment, customer acquisition costs (CAC) are rising steadily due to increasing advertising prices and the saturation of digital channels. At the same time, companies already have a base of customers who have previously purchased and demonstrated trust in the brand.

Compared to cultivating a brand-new customer, re-engaging an existing one is often far more efficient and profitable. Therefore, rather than focusing exclusively on acquisition, many firms are shifting attention to customer retention and win-back strategies.

This sets up a practical and valuable business question:

👉 Given a limited budget (e.g., $100,000), how can a company allocate resources to maximize the number of high-value customers it can retain or win back?

Answering this question requires not only predicting churn probabilities but also optimizing budget allocation—choosing the right subset of customers to target for retention, such that the expected return is maximized under financial constraints.

2. The Cost of Churn and Why Retention Matters

A large body of research and industry evidence consistently shows that retaining existing customers is significantly cheaper and more profitable than acquiring new ones:

Customer acquisition is 5–25x more expensive than retention.

Increasing customer retention rates by just 5% can increase profits by 25% to 95%.

On average, it costs 5–7x more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one.

Academic evidence:

Zhang (2021) notes that acquisition costs are often 5–8 times higher than retention costs【Zhang 2021†source】.

Ascarza et al. (2016) highlight in a telecom case that proactive churn prevention strategies have measurable financial benefits【HBS†source】.
